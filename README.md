This is our project called "CodeConnect".
We created it based on the problem statement where there was a need to create a coding discussion forum where there would be different categories such as Data Structures, Web Development, Competitive Programming, etc. where users can easily discuss their doubts and post their queries and others can add answers to their queries.

The application has two ways to sign-in:
   - Using email
   - Using Google

The feature to sign-in using email is currently under process. Use the Google sign-in method to log in.

This is just a prototype, so basically this gives an idea of how our application will be.

As of now, users can add new posts in the dashboard section. Users can also upvote or downvote a certain post and add comments.
DISCLAIMER : After posting, wait for a few seconds for the blog to appear. Same is the case with comments. There is a latency issue that will be resolved later.

However, features like navigating to different categories, asking mentor for doubts, are not available.
